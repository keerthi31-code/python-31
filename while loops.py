# while loop is mainly concentrates on intialization, condition, increment ot decrement.
# a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is True.
#When the condition becomes False, the loop stops, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

# i=1
# while i<=5:
#     print("python ",end="")

#     while j<=4:

#         j=j+1
#     print()
#     i=i+1
